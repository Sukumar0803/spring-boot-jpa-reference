Fetch Types in Hibernate:
------------------------------------------
EAGER
Load the associated data of the other entity, beforehand which is bit costly.

LAZY
Load the associated data of the other entity, only when requested. This is done on demand.

There are specified fetching types for each relationship type which is applied by Hibernate by default.
OneToMany: LAZY
ManyToOne: EAGER
ManyToMany: LAZY
OneToOne: EAGER


If we are using Lazy --> Ensure to have @Transactional to Fetch Other Entity

@Transaction --> Keep the Persistnat context till end


Inheritence:
Best approach --> Joined

JPA Caching:
-----------------------
First Level Cache - Default:
Second Level Cache - Ecache


@Embeddable --> Seperate Entity
@Embededed -- To persist with in the entity

@ToString --> Avoidable --> JPA cause few issues

For Enums:
-------------------
 @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
  private Role role;
